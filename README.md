# SparkNetworksProject
This repository is for my Spark Networks coding exercise.

For my exercise I decided to tackle the [editable profile](https://github.com/sparknetworks/coding_exercises_options/tree/master/editable_profile)  project.

## Technologies:

I chose to use Node.js for server side technology using the following modules:
- **boom** -     			HTTP-friendly error objects.
- **dotenv** - 				Zero-dependency module that loads environment variables.
- **hapi** - 					A rich framework for building applications and services.
- **hapi-mongodb**  - A simple Hapi MongoDB connection plugin.
- **hapi-pino** - 			Hapi plugin for the Pino logger. It logs in JSON for easy post-processing.
- **joi** - 						Object schema description language and validator for JavaScript objects.
